# weiboSearchEngine
A task finished in old years

In about 2011 or 2012, I do this for a web mining course. 

This is a search engine for a social media (Weibo) platform. In this task, we have to segment Chinese word at first, then we form 
a top-k ranking algorithm to rank the related words. The data clearance and index building are finished with the help of Lucent.

For details, please leave a message.
